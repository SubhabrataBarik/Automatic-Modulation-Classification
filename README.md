Implemented a CNN-based model for automatic modulation classification across different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs).
Achieved a classification test accuracy of 68.12%, enhancing the model's efficiency in signal identification.
Reduced model test loss to 0.846, improving the overall performance and reliability of the classification system.
